Use this space for notes on the day's solution and to document what you've learned!

## Part 1

This was a standard grid problem for AOC. I defined a Enum called Direction to handle
the searching around each place in the grid.

## Part 2

I was originally thinking that this was a recursion problem, however, I think the best
solution is for a while loop to keep removing rolls after each phase.
