# Day 19 (2023)

`Aplenty` ([prompt](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/19))

## Part 1

My first solution to this was a bit verbose with namedtuples and lots of logic.
Afterwards I simplified it down to something more manageable.

## Part 2

This and day 5 were very difficult with needing to parse range of numbers, I
definitely need more practice with how to think through these. I learned about
the https://sankeymatic.com/build/ website for visualizing Sankey Diagrams.
